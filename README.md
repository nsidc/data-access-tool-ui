# Everest UI 

A user interface for placing Hermes data orders on a dataproduct landing page.

## Requirements

NodeJS (and npm!)

## Install dependencies:
With npm:

        $ npm install

## Development

### Option 1: Continuously build & deploy independently

1. You can run the webpack-dev-server so the app is served up
   by a web server.

        $ npm start

2. Now you can [open the app and see live
   changes](http://localhost:8080/). Make changes to the code and see
   them live. The page will refresh automatically.

### Option 2: Continuously build & deploy in Drupal

## Deployment
