**NOTE: on July 1, 2024 we realized that changes to support cloud-collections in
v2.1.0 broke hermes-brokered orders ("Order Files" button) for cloud-enabled
collections. See the PSS ticket here:
<https://nsidc.atlassian.net/browse/PSS-663>. V2.1.0 was rolled back to v2.0.0
as a result. The plan now is to wait to roll out v2.1.0 changes until we
completely remove the "Order Files" button (see
<https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/everest-ui/pull-requests/216>). The next
anticipated release will be v3.0.0. The timing of this change is still subject
to discussion.**
